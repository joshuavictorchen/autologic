# Autologic

This program generates heat + worker assignments for autocross events.

It provides a framework that can be used to programmatically assign `Categories` (car classes) to `Heats`, and `Participants` to roles (work assignments), for a given `Event`.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is a minimum viable prototype product.** It will be cleaned, documented, de-spaghettified, and made more generally applicable after it's gained some field experience at actual events.

## Contributions

Modules placed in the [./source/algorithms/](./source/algorithms/) directory are auto-discovered and exposed as an `--algorithm` choice in the CLI, provided they define exactly one subclass of [HeatGenerator](./source/algorithms/_base.py) that is decorated with [@register](./source/algorithms/_registry.py).

- See [example.py](./source/algorithms/example.py) for a sample scaffold.

Each pluginâ€™s `generate()` method is given a fully initialized `Event` object. Inside it, the plugin must assign all `Categories` to `Heats`, and assign all `Participants` to roles, by mutating the `Event` in place.

- See how the `generate()` method is called in [autologic.py](./source/autologic.py).

Once the `Event` is returned, `Event.validate()` is called to perform a series of validation checks (are all role requirements fulfilled within each `Heat`; do all `Heats` contain a similar number of `Participants`; are Novices evenly distributed across `Heats`; etc.). If the checks pass, then the `Event` is saved and outputs are generated.

## Retrieval and use

1. Download `autologic.exe` from the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/joshuavictorchen/autologic/releases/).

2. Open a terminal window and execute `.\path\to\autologic.exe --config .\path\to\config_file.yaml --algorithm name_of_module` to generate heat and worker assignments for a set of configured parameters.

    - See [sample_event_config.yaml](./tests/sample_event_config.yaml) for an example of a configuration file.
    - See [sample_axware_export.tsv](./tests/sample_axware_export.tsv) (pulled from AXWare) and [sample_member_attributes.csv](./tests/sample_member_attributes.csv) (maintained by worker coordinators) for examples of the expected input data structures.
    - If no `--algorithm` argument is provided, [randomize.py](./source/algorithms/randomize.py) is used by default.

3. Load an `Event` configuration and manipulate it by executing `.\path\to\autologic.exe --load .\path\to\event.pkl` and follow the prompts to:

    - Move a `Category` to a different `Heat`
    - Rotate `Heat` run/work groups
    - Update a `Participant`' assignment
    - Run `Event` validation checks
    - Export data
